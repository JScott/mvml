# MVML

The official MVML interpreter. Converts to HTML/WebGL to view 3D spaces in your browser.

## Goal

WebGL finally lets us share 3D worlds with each other but it's still restricted to those with advanced code knowledge. Even the wonderful [three.js](http://threejs.org/) framework requires [considerable boilerplate](http://jsfiddle.net/5hgbu/) to get results. MVML aims to enable your average content-creator to display their browser content in 3D at least as easily as they would in HTML for 2D.

# Getting started

Download the zip from the `dist` folder and add the scripts to your site.

To use the API, follow the example of `spec.html`. Happy building!

# Building it yourself

`npm install`

`gulp zip`

Then just use the new distribution in `dist`.
