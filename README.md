# MVML

The official MVML interpreter. Converts to HTML/WebGL to view 3D spaces in your browser.

## Goal

WebGL finally lets us share 3D worlds with each other but it's still restricted to those with advanced code knowledge. Even the wonderful [three.js](http://threejs.org/) framework requires [considerable boilerplate](http://jsfiddle.net/5hgbu/) to get results. MVML aims to enable your average content-creator to display their browser content in 3D at least as easily as they would in HTML for 2D.

# Getting started

Download this repository and copy the files in `lib` to your own site. Then just use `spec.html` as a template on how to use the library. Happy building!
